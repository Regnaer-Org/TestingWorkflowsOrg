# Enhanced Fact-Finding Interview Questions & Seminar Outline

---

## Output 1: Enhanced Fact-Finding Interview Questions

The new questions are more targeted, probing the gap between their high-level domain skills and the technical/process skills needed for modern BI, including AI.

### Category 1: Understanding the Current Workflow & "Action Plan"
(Goal: To map the current process and identify "False Starts")

> "Walk me through the last State of the Market report. From the initial data pull to the final PDF, where did you spend the most time?"

> "How do you currently prioritize between a 'keep the lights on' task (like a Market Reference Guide update) and a new, innovative project (like adding a new feature to GC Compare)?"

> "When you get a vague request, how do you get the clarity needed to start? Can you give me an example of a project that had a 'False Start'?"

> "What does the hand-off between regions (e.g., Mumbai to NA) look like? Where are the friction points?"

---

### Category 2: Understanding "Resources" & "Skills"
(Goal: To uncover "Frustration" and "Anxiety")

> "I see you have access to powerful tools like A.M. Best, Conning, and Axco. How much of your time is spent manually extracting and reformatting data from these sources before the real analysis can even begin?"

(Addresses the 'Excel' complaint):  
> "The training available (Financial Reporting, P&C Insurance) is great for domain expertise. Where do you feel the technical skill gaps are? (e.g., advanced Power BI, data automation, Python, etc.)"

(Addresses the leader's AI interest):  
> "Your leadership has expressed a strong interest in using new technologies like AI/LLMs. What's your immediate reaction to that? Does it sound exciting or anxious?"

> "When you hit a technical roadblock (like a Power BI query) versus a domain roadblock (like interpreting a rating), where do you go for help? Is one easier to solve than the other?"

---

### Category 3: Understanding "Vision" & "Incentives"
(Goal: To identify "Confusion" and "Resistance")

(Addresses the leader's AI interest):  
> "If you had a great idea for using AI to, say, summarize Insurance Insider articles or enhance GC Compare, what would be the biggest barriers to experimenting with it?"

> "How do you know when a report or dashboard is 'done' and 'successful'? What does that feedback look like?"

> "When you find a new, more efficient way to do something (a new data source, a better analysis model), how is that shared with the rest of the global team?"

> "What's the one thing that, if we could fix it, would make your team's work more impactful or your job less frustrating?"

## Output 2: Enhanced Seminar Outline

This outline now uses the leader's AI vision as the central "hook" to demonstrate the necessity of project management. It's no longer just about "being organized"; it's about "creating capacity for innovation."

**Title:** From Insight to Impact: A Framework for Our Future-Focused BI Team  
**Audience:** Global Business Intelligence Team  
**Goal:** To introduce a practical framework that streamlines our core work so we can build capacity for high-impact, innovative projects (like AI).

---

### Module 1: Our "Why" — The "Vision" (15 min)

- Hook: Start with the Team's Vision Statement. "We are committed to helping you to understand..."
- The Dual Vision: "We have two critical missions:
  - Deliver world-class, timely market intelligence (our core products).
  - Innovate and explore new technologies (like AI) to create the next generation of insights."
- The Problem (The "Confusion"):  
  "The innovation part is hard. Why? Because we're often trapped in 'fire drills,' manual data pulls (from A.M. Best, Conning), and re-work. We lack the process to protect our time for R&D."
- The Framework for Change: Introduce your leader's model:  
  Successful Change = Vision + Skills + Incentives + Resources + Action Plan
- Messaging:  
  "Today, we're introducing a lightweight 'Action Plan' that gives us the 'Resources' (time) and builds the 'Skills' to achieve our 'Vision'."

---

### Module 2: The "Action Plan" — Making Our Work Visible (And Strategic) (20 min)

- The Problem (The "False Starts"):  
  "You can't manage what you can't see. And we can't prioritize innovation if it's mixed in with 100 other requests."
- The PM Principle (Kanban): Introduce a simple digital Kanban board (e.g., Microsoft Planner).
- The "Common Sense" Solution: We won't just list tasks; we'll categorize our work.
- Show a board with Swimlanes (or Labels):
  - Production: Our repeating work (State of the Market, Cat Loss Summaries).
  - Development: New, one-time projects (New GC Compare feature).
  - R&D (Experiments): New ideas ("Test LLM on Insider feeds").
- Benefit: This visual separation allows us to intentionally allocate capacity (e.g., 20% of our time) to R&D and Development, solving the "False Start" problem for innovative ideas.

---

### Module 3: The "Skills" & "Resources" — Solving "Anxiety" & "Frustration" (20 min)

- The Problem:  
  "Our training is in what to analyze (Reinsurance, Credit Risk). But our 'Frustration' comes from how we analyze (manual data pulls, stuck in Excel)."
- PM Principles (Agile, PMBOK): "Continuous Improvement" & "Resource Management."
- The "Common Sense" Solution:
  - Resources (Solving "Frustration"): Create a Central "BI Resource Hub" (Teams Channel) for our technical resources, templates, and expert list.
  - Skills (Solving "Anxiety"): Launch the "BI Brown Bag" Series. This is not more finance training. This is team-led technical training.
- Example Topics:
  - "Beyond Excel: Automating data pulls from NAIC"
  - "My 5 favorite Power BI tricks"
  - "What is an LLM? A 30-min primer for analysts."
- Benefit: We build the internal technical skills needed to execute our leader's AI vision and reduce our reliance on outdated methods.

---

### Module 4: The "Incentives" — Defining & Celebrating Success (15–20 min)

- The Problem (The "Resistance"):  
  "Why change? My process works." or "Why should I try a risky R&D project if it might 'fail'?"
- PM Principles (Scrum): "Definition of Done" & "Sprint Review/Demo."
- The "Common Sense" Solution:
  - The "BI Project Brief" (1-Page Template):
    - We change the definition of "Done" based on the work type.
      - Production = "Delivered to stakeholder."
      - R&D = "Hypothesis tested; learning documented." (This makes it "safe" to experiment).
  - The "BI Product & Learning Showcase" (Bi-weekly):
    - Anyone who moved a card to "Done" gets 5–10 minutes.
    - You can demo a new report or share what you learned from a failed AI experiment.
- Benefit: This creates "Incentives" by celebrating both delivery and learning, which is essential for innovation.

---

### Module 5: Next Steps — Our Implementation Plan (5 min)

- "This isn't a 'big bang.' We will roll this out in three simple phases."
- Introduce the Phased Plan (see Output 3).

---

## Output 3: "Common Sense" Implementation Plan (Phased)

This plan is explicitly designed to create a "two-speed" system that protects R&D and innovation—a key requirement to act on the leader's AI interest.

**Guiding Principle:** "We will separate our run-the-business work from our change-the-business work, so we can excel at both."

---

### Phase 1: Make Work Visible & Strategic (First 30 Days)
**Goal:** Solve "False Starts" & "Confusion." Create a single source of truth for all work types.

**Actions:**
- You: Select and set up the Kanban board (e.g., Microsoft Planner).
- You: Critically, create Labels or Swimlanes for the three work types:
  - Production (Repeating, core reports)
  - Development (New, defined projects)
  - R&D (Experiment) (New, high-uncertainty ideas, e.g., AI)
- You + Team: Hold a 90-min "Backlog Population" session. Go through every current project and assign it to a column (Backlog, In Progress) AND a work type.

**New Ritual Introduced:**
- The 30-min Weekly "BI Huddle":
  - Agenda: 1. Review In Progress (any blockers?). 2. Look at Up Next and agree on the week's commitments, balancing the work types. (e.g., "This week we will deliver the Cat Loss Summary AND start the 2-week AI summarization experiment.")

---

### Phase 2: Standardize the "Ask" & Share Learning (Days 30–60)
**Goal:** Improve "Vision" (per-project) and provide "Incentives" for innovation.

**Actions:**
- You: Create the "BI Project Brief" (1-Page Template).
- You: Introduce two versions of the brief:
  - Standard Brief (for Production/Development): Focus on Scope, Audience, Deadline, Deliverable.
  - Experiment Brief (for R&D): Focus on Hypothesis, Time-Box (e.g., 2 weeks), Data, Success Metric (Learning).
- You: Mandate that no new project moves from Backlog to Up Next without a completed brief.

**New Rituals Introduced:**
- The 30-min Bi-weekly "BI Product & Learning Showcase":
  - Agenda: Team demos new reports and shares findings from R&D experiments. This is where you celebrate learning, even from "failures."
- The 60-min Bi-weekly "BI Brown Bag" (Lunch & Learn):
  - Agenda: Kick off the technical skills track. Ask for volunteers to share a Power BI trick or automation script.

---

### Phase 3: Refine and Improve (Day 90+)
**Goal:** Embed "Continuous Improvement" as a core practice.

**Actions:**
- You: Hold the first Quarterly 60-min Retrospective.
  - Agenda:
    1. What's working?
    2. What's not?
    3. How is our Production vs. R&D balance? Are we protecting innovation time?
    4. What's one thing to improve next quarter?

**Success Metrics (for you to show your leader):**
- Qualitative: Reduced team frustration. Positive feedback on the "Showcase."
- Quantitative: Reduction in re-work. Increased throughput of "Done" cards.
- (New) Innovation Metric: Number of R&D experiments run per quarter (this will be highly visible and valuable to your stakeholder).

# Artifacts, Metrics, and Learning

Summary: Artifacts, Metrics, and Learning  
This section details the tangible items ("artifacts") we will create, the metrics we will use to measure success, and resources for anyone who wants to learn more.

---

## 1. List of Outputs (Our "Artifacts")

These are the only new tangible items the team will need to create. They are designed to be simple and replace existing, less efficient processes (like status update emails or vague project requests).

- **The Global BI Kanban Board**  
  The single source of truth for all work. This is a digital board (MS Planner, Trello, etc.) that visually tracks every project.

- **The "BI Project Brief" (Standard)**  
  A 1‑page template (e.g., an MS Form or fields on a planner card) that defines any new Production or Development project. It answers:
  - What's the question?
  - Who is the audience?
  - What's the deadline?
  - What does "Done" look like?

- **The "BI Experiment Brief" (R&D)**  
  A simplified brief for R&D work. It answers:
  - What's our hypothesis?
  - What's the time-box (e.g., 2 weeks)?
  - What data do we need?
  - What does "learning" look like?

- **The BI Resource Hub**  
  A central location (e.g., a Teams Channel or SharePoint site) for key resources, templates, data source links, and the "who-to-ask" expert list.

- **Showcase & Retro Summaries**  
  Simple, bullet-point notes from the "Product & Learning Showcase" and "Quarterly Retrospective" to track successes, learnings, and action items for improvement.

---

## 2. Key Metrics for Success

We will track a few simple metrics to prove this new process is working. The data can be captured directly from the Kanban board.

| Metric | How to Capture | How to Interpret | Value It Provides |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project Throughput | Count the number of cards moved to the "Done" column per month. | A steady or increasing number indicates improved efficiency, flow, and fewer bottlenecks. | Proves the team is delivering more value with less friction. Helps in forecasting future work. |
| Work Type Balance | Quarterly, count the "Done" cards by label: Production vs. Development vs. R&D. | Are we meeting our goal (e.g., 20% R&D)? Or is Production (fire-fighting) taking over? | This is the key metric for your leader. It proves you are creating capacity for high-value innovative work (like AI) instead of just "keeping the lights on." |
| Qualitative Feedback | Notes from the "Quarterly Retrospective" ("What worked? What didn't?"). | Look for trends. Are "Frustration" comments decreasing? Are "Skills" or "Incentives" comments increasing? | Measures team morale and validates the 5‑part change model. Tells you where to focus your next improvement. |
| Rework Rate | Count how many cards move backward (e.g., from "In Review" to "In Progress"). | A high rate means the "Project Brief" isn't clear enough or scope is changing. A low rate means "Vision" is clear. | A direct measure of wasted effort. Reducing it frees up significant team capacity. |

## 3. Additional Resources (For Self-Study)

For team members who are interested in the "why" behind these concepts, here are practical, non-academic resources:

- Website: **Atlassian's Agile Coach**  
  One of the best free resources on the web. Simple, practical guides on Kanban, Scrum, retrospectives, and more — written for real-world teams.

- Book: **Making Work Visible** by Dominica DeGrandis  
  A short, focused book on using Kanban to manage "knowledge work" (like BI and analysis). Great for teams overwhelmed by invisible requests.

- Book: **The Phoenix Project** by Gene Kim  
  A novel that teaches core concepts of Agile, flow, and bottlenecks through an engaging story. Highly recommended for you and your stakeholder.

- Online Learning: **LinkedIn Learning** (if available at your firm)  
  Search for courses such as "Agile Foundations," "Kanban Fundamentals," or "Agile for Non-Technical Teams." These 1–2 hour courses are great primers.

---

## Notes / Next Steps (suggested)
- Publish the markdown to the BI Resource Hub (Teams/SharePoint) and link it from the Kanban board.
- Create the initial templates (BI Project Brief and BI Experiment Brief) and add them to the Resource Hub.
- Start capturing the metrics from Day 1 on the Kanban board to build baseline data.
