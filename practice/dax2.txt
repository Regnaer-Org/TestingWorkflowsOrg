Why Vertical Slices Help Your Situation:

Combats Front-end/Back-end Desynchronization: By definition, a vertical slice requires both front-end and back-end work (if applicable for that slice) to be completed together. This forces collaboration and ensures integration from the start.
Reduces Integration and Testing Issues: Testing happens on a complete piece of functionality, making it easier to identify and fix bugs earlier.
Addresses Improper/Overly Technical Stories: Vertical slices are framed from the user's perspective (e.g., "As a user, I want to X so that Y"). This naturally makes stories less technical and more focused on value.
Validates Technical Feasibility Sooner: When a slice includes UI, back-end logic, and potentially infrastructure, you're forced to consider the technical feasibility of the whole piece early on, rather than designing a UI in isolation.
Handles Infrastructure Needs: Infrastructure setup can be a "slice zero" or an early slice that enables subsequent user-facing slices. The key is that it's planned as part of the deliverable functionality.
Supports Independent Team Work (Mostly): While your shared UI repo adds complexity, vertical slices can still be defined for each team. The focus will be on clear API contracts and communication where slices might touch shared components.
Applying Vertical Slices to Your Context:

Here's a suggested approach for breaking down work:

1. Epics: Large User-Centric Goals

Definition: An Epic should represent a significant, high-level user goal or a large piece of functionality that can be broken down into smaller, deliverable features.
Example (Actuarial Analytics - Exposure Rating Module):
"As an Actuary, I want to perform a comprehensive exposure rating analysis for a new policy, including data import, parameter adjustment, and result visualization, so that I can accurately assess risk."
Example (Desktop Application Recreation - Model Building):
"As a Risk Analyst, I want to build a new loss model by defining its structure, inputting parameters, and validating its initial output, so that I can use it for simulations."
Key for your teams: Even if an Epic seems heavily back-end (like algorithm enhancements), frame it from the perspective of what the user or the system achieves. If an algorithm change doesn't result in a perceivable difference or new capability for a user (or another system component), question its standalone value or how it fits into a larger user-facing Epic.
2. Features: Deliverable Chunks of Value within an Epic

Definition: A Feature is a smaller, still valuable, piece of functionality that contributes to an Epic. It should be deliverable within a few sprints (or your release cadence). Features are also vertically sliced.
Example (Epic: Exposure Rating Analysis):
Feature 1: "As an Actuary, I can import exposure data from a CSV file so that it can be used in the rating algorithm." (Involves UI for upload, back-end for parsing/validation, data storage)
Feature 2: "As an Actuary, I can adjust key rating parameters (e.g., loss cost, trend factor) via a form so that I can customize the analysis." (Involves UI for form, back-end for updating parameters, logic for applying them)
Feature 3: "As an Actuary, I can view the initial rated premium based on imported data and default parameters so that I have a baseline." (Involves UI for display, back-end for calculation and data retrieval)
Example (Epic: Model Building):
Feature 1: "As a Risk Analyst, I can define the basic structure of a new model (e.g., name, type, description) so that it can be saved and identified."
Feature 2: "As a Risk Analyst, I can add input nodes for key variables (e.g., frequency, severity) to my model structure."
Feature 3: "As a Risk Analyst, I can connect input nodes to a calculation node that applies a basic formula."
Key for your teams:
Algorithm Enhancements: For the team focused on algorithms, a Feature might be: "As the system, I can apply the enhanced 'XYZ' blending algorithm to the selected dataset and provide the updated blended result, so that the Actuary sees a more accurate outcome." This still implies a way to trigger it and see the result, even if the UI change is minimal (e.g., a new option in a dropdown, a different value in a result table).
Shared UI Repo: When a feature requires changes in the shared UI repo and a module-specific repo, this is where clear communication and potentially "contract-first" API development between teams become crucial. One team might own the end-to-end feature, coordinating with others, or you might have a designated UI/UX specialist who helps ensure consistency and manages shared component changes.
3. Stories: Small, Testable, Implementable Slices

Definition: A User Story is the smallest unit of work that delivers a demonstrable piece of functionality and can typically be completed by the team in a single sprint (or a few days). It must be a vertical slice.
INVEST Criteria: Good stories are Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable.
Example (Feature: Import exposure data from CSV):
Story 1: "As an Actuary, I can select a CSV file from my computer using a file picker, so that I can initiate the data import." (UI: file picker button. Back-end: stub for receiving a file).
Story 2: "As an Actuary, upon selecting a CSV, the system will validate the column headers against the expected format and show me an error if they don't match, so that I can correct my file." (UI: error message display. Back-end: header validation logic).
Story 3: "As an Actuary, if my CSV headers are valid, the system will parse the first 10 rows and display them in a preview table, so that I can confirm the data looks correct before full import." (UI: preview table. Back-end: parsing logic, temporary storage/display of preview data).
Key for your teams:
No "Front-end Story" or "Back-end Story": Avoid "Create API endpoint for X" or "Build UI for Y" as stories. Instead: "As a user, I can click the 'Save' button on the exposure data form, and my changes are persisted so that I don't lose my work." This implies UI (button), front-end logic (calling API), API endpoint, back-end logic (saving data), and database interaction.
Technical/Enabling Stories: Sometimes you need stories for things that aren't directly user-facing but enable future user stories (e.g., "Set up database schema for exposure data," "Refactor service X to support new parameter Y").
Try to tie these to the next user-facing story they enable.
Keep them small and ensure their completion unblocks tangible user value quickly.
These are sometimes called "Enabler Stories" and are a pragmatic way to handle necessary groundwork. However, the goal is always to integrate this work into a user-valuable slice as soon as possible. If you have too many enabler stories, it might be a sign that your slices are still too horizontal.
Addressing Your Specific Challenges with Vertical Slices:

Shared UI Repo Complexity:
Clear API Contracts: Teams need to agree on APIs between the shared UI and the module-specific back-ends.
Component-Based UI Development: If your shared UI uses a component library, new features might involve creating new shared components or extending existing ones. This work needs to be coordinated.
Dedicated UI/UX Coordination: Consider having a UI/UX specialist or a cross-team working group that focuses on the shared UI to ensure consistency and manage dependencies.
Feature Toggles: For larger UI changes in the shared repo, feature toggles can allow teams to integrate their work without impacting other teams or releasing unfinished UIs.
Algorithm-Heavy Work:
Focus on the impact of the algorithm change. How does it manifest to the user or the system?
Even a small UI change to expose a new parameter, display a new result, or select a different algorithm version makes the work a vertical slice.
If an algorithm change is purely internal with no user-facing impact (e.g., performance optimization), the "story" might be about proving the optimization (e.g., "System processes X dataset 50% faster, verified by benchmark Y").
Recreating Desktop Application:
This is a prime candidate for vertical slicing. Don't try to rebuild the entire old UI and then hook it up.
Identify the most critical user workflows from the desktop app.
Deliver them end-to-end, one slice at a time, in the new web product. For example, a slice for "User can create a new basic model file and see it listed" before trying to implement all modeling features.
How to Get Started / Transition:

Team Education & Buy-in: Explain the "why" behind vertical slicing and how it addresses their current pain points.
Practice Story Mapping: Use a story mapping exercise for an upcoming Epic. This visual technique helps identify user steps and then slice them vertically.
Start Small: Pick one upcoming Feature or a small Epic to try this approach with.
Cross-Functional Collaboration: Emphasize that developers (front-end, back-end), QAs, and product owners need to work together closely to define and implement these slices.
Definition of Done: Ensure your Definition of Done for a story includes all layers (UI, back-end, tests, etc.) being complete and integrated.
Retrospectives: Regularly discuss what's working and what's not with the new approach and adjust.
Example for the team struggling with algorithm enhancements:

Let's say they need to implement a "New Advanced Blending Algorithm."

Bad (Horizontal) Stories:

"BE: Implement Advanced Blending Algorithm logic."
"BE: Create API endpoint to trigger Advanced Blending."
"FE: Add 'Use Advanced Blending' checkbox to UI."
"FE: Call new API when checkbox is ticked."
"QA: Test Advanced Blending."
Good (Vertical) Stories:

Story 1: "As an Actuary, I can select 'Advanced Blending' from the algorithm options for my current dataset, so that the system uses the new calculation method." (Involves: UI change for selection, FE logic to pass selection, BE logic to recognize selection and call a stub of the new algorithm, perhaps returning a dummy/expected value initially).
Story 2: "As an Actuary, when 'Advanced Blending' is selected, the system applies the core logic of the new algorithm (part 1 of N) to the data and I see the updated primary result, so I can verify its basic effect." (Involves: BE implementing a part of the algorithm, FE displaying the result).
Story 3 (and so on): "As an Actuary, when 'Advanced Blending' is selected, the system incorporates parameter X into the calculation and I see its effect on the results, so I can fine-tune the blend." (Incrementally build out the algorithm and its interaction points).
This approach will force the "building blocks" and "front-end interaction" to happen in smaller, integrated steps, rather than in large, disconnected phases.

It's a shift in mindset, but it directly tackles the problems you've described by forcing earlier integration and a constant focus on delivering user value.

I can use Bing to find some well-regarded articles or resources on vertical slicing and story mapping if you'd like some external references to share with your teams.Okay, I can help you with that. Here are some resources that explain vertical slicing and user story mapping. You can share these with your teams to help them understand the concepts better. It sounds like you're facing a common challenge in agile development, especially with complex, multi-team projects. Moving towards vertical slicing and a clearer Epic > Feature > Story breakdown can definitely help. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, incorporating the context you've provided:

Understanding Vertical Slicing

Think of your product as a cake.

Horizontal Slicing (the "bad habit"): This is like taking a layer of the cake (e.g., just the frosting, or just one layer of sponge). In software, this translates to "front-end stories" or "back-end stories." As you've experienced, this leads to:
Delayed integration and testing.
One team waiting for another.
Difficulty in delivering a truly "done" and usable increment of value.
Vertical Slicing (the goal): This is like taking a full slice of the cake, from top to bottom, including frosting, sponge, and filling. In software, a vertical slice is a user story that touches all necessary architectural layers (UI, services, database, algorithms, etc.) to deliver a small, demonstrable piece of user-facing functionality.
Benefits of Vertical Slicing for Your Teams:

Delivers Tangible Value Sooner: Each story, when completed, provides a working piece of functionality that can (ideally) be demonstrated and get feedback.
Reduces Integration Risk: Integration happens continuously within the story, not as a separate, risky phase at the end.
Improves Team Collaboration: Encourages front-end and back-end developers (and testers, designers, etc.) to work together on the same piece of functionality.
Highlights Technical Dependencies Early: If a UI change needs a new API endpoint, that dependency is clear from the start of the story.
Facilitates True "Done" Increments: A story isn't "done" until it's fully integrated, tested, and provides user value.
Guidance for Your Teams: Epic > Feature > Story Breakdown with Vertical Slicing

Here's how you can guide your teams to better break down requirements:

1. Start with the User and Their Goals (Epics & Features):

Epics: These are large bodies of work that can be broken down into multiple features. They represent significant user goals or business objectives.
Example for Actuarial Analytics: "Enhance Exposure Rating Capabilities" or "Implement Loss View Management for Online Product."
Features: These are distinct functionalities that deliver value to the user and contribute to an Epic. A feature should still be user-centric.
Example (Exposure Rating): "Allow actuaries to blend experience and exposure rating results."
Example (Loss View): "Enable users to create and save custom loss views."
2. The Power of User Story Mapping:

Before diving into individual stories, facilitate User Story Mapping sessions for each Feature (or even Epic if it's not too large). This is a collaborative exercise involving the whole team (product, design, dev, QA).
How it works:
Identify the User Journey/Workflow: Map out the steps a user takes to achieve the goal of the feature. These steps become the "backbone" of your map.
Brainstorm Activities/Tasks: Under each step of the journey, brainstorm the specific actions or tasks the user performs. These are candidates for your user stories.
Prioritize and Slice for Releases: Arrange these tasks by priority and then "slice" the map horizontally to define what can be delivered in an iteration or release. The key is that each slice should still represent end-to-end functionality.
3. Crafting Vertically Sliced User Stories:

Focus on User Value, Not Technical Layers:
Bad (Horizontal):
"As a developer, I want to create an API endpoint for blending rating results." (Backend story)
"As a developer, I want to build a UI screen to display blended rating results." (Frontend story)
Good (Vertical): "As an actuary, I want to be able to select experience and exposure rating results and see a blended outcome, so that I can refine my analysis."
INVEST Criteria: Good user stories are:
Independent: As much as possible, stories should be independent of each other.
Negotiable: Not a rigid contract; details can be discussed and refined.
Valuable: Delivers value to the end-user (or stakeholder).
Estimable: The team can roughly estimate the effort.
Small: Small enough to be completed within an iteration. This is where vertical slicing is crucial. If a story feels too big, it's often because it's not sliced thinly enough or it's actually a feature.
Testable: There are clear acceptance criteria to verify it's done.
Acceptance Criteria are Key: For each vertically sliced story, define clear acceptance criteria that cover all aspects of the functionality, including UI interactions, data processing, and expected outcomes. This ensures everyone understands what "done" means.
Example (Blending Story):
"Given I am on the rating results page,"
"When I select one experience rating result and one exposure rating result,"
"And I click the 'Blend' button,"
"Then I should see a new section displaying the blended figures [specify key figures]."
"And the system correctly applies the blending algorithm [may require more specific criteria]."
Addressing Your Specific Challenges:

Shared Front-End Repo:
Vertical slicing helps here because a feature team takes ownership of delivering the entire user-facing functionality, even if it touches the shared UI.
Communication is critical: Teams need to be aware of what others are working on in the shared UI to avoid conflicts. Regular (even daily) brief sync-ups between tech leads or UI-focused devs from different teams might be needed.
Consider feature flags or branching strategies in the UI repo to isolate changes until they are ready for integration.
Algorithm-Heavy Backend Changes (Exposure Rating Team):
Even if the bulk of the work is in the algorithm, try to find the smallest user-facing change that can validate a part of that algorithm.
Instead of: "Improve algorithm X."
Try: "As an actuary, I want to input parameter Y into algorithm X and see the impact on output Z, so I can test the new sensitivity." This might involve a very simple UI (even if temporary or for internal testing) to input Y and display Z.
If the changes are purely backend with no immediate UI impact, the "user" might be another system or a data analyst. Frame the story from that perspective. "As a downstream reporting system, I need the blending algorithm to expose a new data point X so that I can include it in the quarterly reports."
Recreating Desktop App (Model Building, Loss View Team):
This is a prime candidate for user story mapping. Map out the core workflows of the desktop app.
Slice vertically to deliver small, usable pieces of the online version incrementally. Don't try to rebuild everything at once.
Example: Instead of "Build the file management system," a first slice might be "As a user, I want to upload a single data file for my model so I can begin basic model construction." This touches UI (upload button), services (file handling), and potentially backend storage.
Overly Technical Stories / Upfront Over-Design:
Vertical slicing, by focusing on user value, naturally discourages overly technical stories. The "why" (user value) drives the "what" (technical implementation).
Defer detailed technical design decisions until the story is about to be worked on. The story defines what the user needs; the team figures out how to build it during iteration planning or backlog refinement.
Technical feasibility can be explored through "spikes" – time-boxed research tasks that are themselves small stories. "As a developer, I want to investigate options for [complex technical challenge] for the [user story/feature] so that we can choose the best approach."
Infrastructure Needs:
If infrastructure is blocking user stories, make the infrastructure work itself a "story" or an "enabler task" that clearly supports specific upcoming user stories.
Prioritize infrastructure work that unblocks the highest value user stories.
Sometimes, a vertical slice might include a small piece of infrastructure setup as part of the story.
Implementation Tips:

Start Small: Pick one upcoming feature for one team to try this approach.
Whole Team Involvement: Emphasize that product owners, developers (front-end and back-end), and QA need to collaborate closely in defining and refining these vertical slices.
Visualize: Use physical or digital boards for user story mapping. Make the work visible.
Backlog Refinement: Dedicate time regularly to break down features into vertically sliced stories and ensure they are ready for development. This isn't just a PO task; it's a team activity.
Definition of Done (DoD): Have a clear, shared DoD that reinforces the idea that a story isn't complete until it's integrated, tested across layers, and provides user value.
Retrospectives: Use your retrospectives to discuss how well the vertical slicing is working and what adjustments are needed.
Patience and Persistence: This is a shift in mindset and practice. It will take time and effort.


By consistently asking "What is the smallest piece of end-to-end functionality we can deliver that provides value to the user?", your teams can move towards more effective agile delivery and reduce the frustrations of disconnected development efforts.





                                                                                                That's a very common and understandable pushback from development teams, especially when dealing with a significant undertaking like recreating an existing application. Their concern about needing a stable and proven backend/infrastructure is valid – you can't build robust workflows on a shaky foundation.

However, the "build it all first, then connect the UI" approach (often called a horizontal approach for backend/infrastructure) carries its own significant risks, which vertical slicing aims to mitigate:

Late Integration Risk: If the backend is built in isolation for months, the eventual integration with the UI can become a "big bang" effort, full of surprises, mismatches, and debugging nightmares.
Misinterpreting Requirements: Without a tangible, even simple, workflow to aim for, the backend might be over-engineered in some areas and under-engineered in others, or simply not quite match what the UI/user actually needs.
Delayed Feedback: You get no real user or stakeholder feedback on actual functionality until very late in the process.
Wasted Effort: If architectural assumptions made early in the backend build turn out to be wrong, significant rework might be needed.
Here's how you can frame the conversation and address their specific point:

1. Acknowledge and Validate Their Concern:

"I completely understand the concern about needing a solid backend and infrastructure. We absolutely can't have workflows failing due to unstable core services. The goal isn't to ignore that, but to build and prove it out incrementally."
2. Introduce the "Walking Skeleton" or "Thin End-to-End Slice" Concept:

"Instead of building all the backend infrastructure and all the backend services for all potential workflows upfront, let's identify the absolute bare minimum 'walking skeleton' needed to support the very first, simplest user workflow."
"This first slice might be more heavily weighted towards backend/infrastructure setup, but it must culminate in something tangible, however small, at the UI level. This proves the pipes work from end to end."
3. How Vertical Slicing De-Risks Backend/Infrastructure Development:

Early Proof of Concept: The first vertical slice acts as a proof of concept for your core architecture. If you can get "User can create a new basic model file and see it listed" working, you've proven that:
The UI can communicate with the backend.
Basic data can be saved and retrieved.
Core services (even if very simple versions) are deployable and functioning.
Your deployment pipeline (for this thin slice) works.
Iterative Build-Out: Each subsequent vertical slice will build upon and expand this initial infrastructure.
"The next slice, 'User can add a single parameter to the model,' might require adding a new field to a database table and a new property in an API response. We're not rebuilding; we're extending."
Focused Development: It ensures that the infrastructure being built is directly supporting a demonstrable user need, rather than speculative future requirements.
4. Countering the "None of the Workflows Will Work" Argument:

"You're right, complex workflows won't work if the foundational pieces aren't there. But the first vertical slices aren't complex. They are deliberately chosen to be the simplest possible path to demonstrate value and prove out the core connections."
"If our very first, simplest slice – like 'User sees a welcome message from the backend' or 'User can save a file with only a name' – fails, we've learned something critical about our core infrastructure much earlier and with less investment than if we'd tried to build the entire backend first."
5. Propose a Compromise / Phased Approach within Slicing:

Technical Spikes for Core Unknowns: "If there are specific, high-risk technical unknowns in the backend (e.g., 'Can our chosen database handle this specific type of query efficiently?'), let's address those with a focused, time-boxed technical spike before or as part of the first user-facing vertical slice. This spike's goal is to answer a specific technical question, not to build the whole backend."
Infrastructure as "Enabler Stories": "We can have 'enabler stories' or 'technical stories' that focus on specific backend/infrastructure components, but they should always be directly tied to enabling the next one or two user-facing vertical slices. For example: 'Set up basic authentication service to enable User Login slice.'" The key is that these enabler stories are small and immediately consumed.
API-First within a Slice: "For a given slice, the team can decide to define and build the API endpoint first, test it thoroughly (e.g., with automated tests, Postman), and then build the UI that consumes it. This is still a vertical slice because it's all done within the context of delivering that specific piece of user functionality, and it's completed within the same iteration."
Example Conversation Starters:

"What's the absolute thinnest slice of functionality we can deliver that would require the UI, a service, and the database to talk to each other, even if it's just displaying a single piece of data?"
"Instead of thinking about all backend services needed for the entire desktop app, what's the one service, and the one function within that service, we need for the very first user story?"
"How can we build the backend iteratively, proving out each component as it's needed by a user-facing feature, rather than trying to perfect it all in isolation?"
The goal is to shift their perspective from a monolithic backend build to an incremental one that is continuously validated by working, albeit simple, pieces of user functionality. It's about managing risk and delivering value sooner.
