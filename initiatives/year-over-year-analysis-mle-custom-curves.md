# Initiative: Year over Year analysis MLE Custom Curves

## Personas
[Mid Level Reinsurance Actuary](../../personas/mid-level-reinsurance-actuary.md)

## Problem Statement
Mid-level reinsurance actuaries like Priya Sharma face significant challenges when conducting year-over-year (YoY) analysis of reinsurance portfolios. The current process is hindered by several pain points:

- **Manual Data Handling:** Data required for YoY analysis is often scattered across multiple sources and formats, requiring time-consuming manual cleaning, reconciliation, and transformation before any meaningful analysis can begin.
- **Inconsistent Curve Application:** Existing actuarial models and tools may not support the flexible application of custom curves for loss modeling, making it difficult to compare results across different years or to tailor analyses to specific treaty structures.
- **Limited Automation:** Many steps in the YoY analysis workflow are not automated, leading to repetitive manual tasks that increase the risk of errors and reduce the time available for strategic analysis.
- **Slow Insights:** Tight reporting deadlines and the lack of streamlined tools delay the delivery of actionable insights to underwriters and management, impacting decision-making and business agility.
- **Regulatory Complexity:** Frequent changes in regulatory requirements (e.g., Solvency II, IFRS 17) add further complexity, as actuaries must ensure that YoY analyses remain compliant and well-documented.

The **'Year over Year analysis MLE Custom Curves'** initiative aims to address these challenges by providing a robust, automated solution for applying Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with custom curves to reinsurance data. This will enable actuaries to:

- Efficiently perform consistent and accurate YoY analyses.
- Easily apply and compare custom actuarial curves across multiple years and treaty types.
- Reduce manual effort and error rates through automation.
- Accelerate the delivery of insights for better business and regulatory decisions.

By solving these challenges, the initiative will empower actuaries to focus on higher-value analytical work and strategic portfolio

## Business Case
The 'Year over Year analysis MLE Custom Curves' initiative will transform the actuarial workflow for reinsurance analysis by automating and enhancing the application of custom curves using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). This will directly address key pain points faced by actuaries, resulting in measurable improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and competitive positioning.

- **Time Savings:** Automating data cleaning, reconciliation, and curve application is projected to reduce YoY analysis time by up to 60%, freeing actuaries to focus on higher-value tasks.
- **Faster Reporting:** Streamlined workflows will enable delivery of insights to underwriters and management up to 40% faster, supporting quicker business decisions.


- **Fewer Manual Steps:** Automation will reduce manual data handling and repetitive tasks, decreasing the risk of human error by an estimated 70%.
- **Consistent Methodology:** Standardized application of custom curves ensures reproducibility and compliance, minimizing discrepancies in regulatory reporting.


- **Enhanced Analytical Capability:** Actuaries can rapidly test and compare custom curves, leading to more accurate pricing and risk assessment.
- **Improved Responsiveness:** Faster, more reliable analysis allows the business to respond quickly to market opportunities and regulatory changes.
- **Talent Retention:** By reducing tedious manual work, the initiative improves job satisfaction and helps retain skilled actuarial talent.
