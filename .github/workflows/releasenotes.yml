## Feature: Real-Time Catastrophe Risk Visualization

**Description:**  
Develop an interactive map-based module that provides real-time visualization of multiple catastrophe risks, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods. Users should be able to see current threats and potential impacts on locations of interest.

**Additional Notes:**  
- Integrate reliable external data feeds (e.g., NOAA for hurricanes, USGS for earthquakes).
- Ensure performance for large datasets and smooth user experience.
- Collaborate with UX/UI for intuitive controls and visual clarity.
- Prioritize accessibility (color choices, screen-reader support).

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Map displays live overlays for hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods.
- Users can toggle each catastrophe type layer on/off.
- Map supports zoom, pan, and region selection.
- Data refreshes at least every 30 minutes.
- Visual legend and accessible color palette implemented.

### Stories under this Feature

#### Story: Display live hurricane tracks and projected paths

**Description:**  
Integrate live hurricane data to show current tracks and forecasted paths directly on the catastrophe risk map.

**Additional Notes:**  
- Use trusted data source (e.g., NOAA NHC).
- Include hurricane metadata (name, category, speed).
- Handle multiple simultaneous storms.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Hurricane tracks and forecast cones appear on the map.
- Data updates at least every 30 minutes.
- Clicking a hurricane reveals its details.
- Works with other map overlays enabled.

#### Story: Layer earthquake risk zones on the map

**Description:**  
Add earthquake risk zones as a toggleable overlay, differentiated by region and risk severity.

**Additional Notes:**  
- Use up-to-date seismic hazard data.
- Colorblind-friendly palette required.
- Overlay should be performant at all zoom levels.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Earthquake risk zones are shown with distinct shading.
- User can toggle this layer independently.
- Legend explains risk levels.
- Map performance unaffected.

#### Story: Show flood risk overlays by region

**Description:**  
Overlay flood risk zones on the map, allowing users to filter by region for focused analysis.

**Additional Notes:**  
- Integrate with external flood risk datasets.
- Provide region-based filtering UI.
- Ensure overlays have clear legends.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Flood risk zones are accurately displayed for selected regions.
- Users can filter overlays by region.
- Legends and color keys are present.
- Overlay rendering is efficient.

#### Story: Enable interactive zoom and pan on catastrophe map

**Description:**  
Implement smooth zooming and panning on the risk map, ensuring overlays and property markers remain accurate and responsive.

**Additional Notes:**  
- Keyboard shortcuts for accessibility.
- “Reset to home view” button.
- Test on desktop and mobile browsers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Users can zoom and pan seamlessly.
- All overlays/markers stay aligned during interaction.
- Map resets to default view on command.
- No significant lag at max zoom.

#### Story: Highlight high-risk assets on the map

**Description:**  
Visually distinguish properties with the highest risk scores on the catastrophe risk map.

**Additional Notes:**  
- Define clear risk thresholds for highlighting.
- Use icons/colors that are accessible.
- Tooltips or popovers should provide more detail.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- High-risk properties are clearly highlighted.
- Hover/click shows risk breakdown.
- Highlighting updates in real-time as data changes.
- Visuals meet accessibility standards.

## Feature: Automated Portfolio Risk Assessment

**Description:**  
Implement a system where users (portfolio managers) can upload property portfolios and receive automated, detailed catastrophe risk assessments per asset, with overall portfolio summaries and downloadable reports.

**Additional Notes:**  
- Must validate CSV input and provide clear error feedback.
- Risk scoring logic should be transparent and documented.
- Reports should be available in Markdown, PDF, and CSV.
- Consider GDPR and PII handling for uploaded data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- User can upload a portfolio in standard CSV format.
- System analyzes and scores each property for multiple peril types.
- Results include both per-property details and portfolio summaries.
- Downloadable report (PDF/CSV) is generated.
- High-risk assets are visually highlighted if viewed on the map.

### Stories under this Feature

#### Story: Upload property portfolio via CSV

**Description:**  
Enable users to upload a CSV containing their property portfolio for risk analysis.

**Additional Notes:**  
- Validate column headers and data types.
- Provide sample CSV template for download.
- Handle large file uploads gracefully.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- CSV upload is available via UI.
- System validates format and provides clear errors.
- Properties are queued for risk analysis on upload.
- Upload supports at least 5,000 properties per file.

#### Story: Automated risk scoring for each property

**Description:**  
Generate risk scores for each uploaded property, covering all supported catastrophe types.

**Additional Notes:**  
- Risk scoring model should be transparent and documented.
- Cover edge cases (e.g., missing data, unknown locations).
- Scores should be explainable to end-users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Each property receives per-peril risk scores.
- Scores are included in both UI and downloadable reports.
- Model deals gracefully with incomplete data.
- Documentation for scoring is linked from results.

#### Story: Download portfolio risk assessment report

**Description:**  
Allow users to download a comprehensive risk assessment report after analysis, summarizing portfolio and per-property results.

**Additional Notes:**  
- Include summary statistics and highlights.
- Offer reports in Markdown, PDF, and CSV formats.
- Ensure reports are styled for readability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Users can download reports in at least PDF and CSV.
- Reports include per-property scores and portfolio summary.
- High-risk properties are flagged in the report.
- Reports pass accessibility checks.
