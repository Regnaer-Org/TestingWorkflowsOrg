            You are an expert technical writer. Read the following list of GitHub issues (each with a title and body) that are all assigned to the same milestone. Write a clear, concise, non-repetitive Markdown release note summary that explains what is being delivered in this milestone. Focus on outcomes and key points for users and contributors. Do not simply list the issuesâ€”synthesize the information and avoid repetition. Output only the Markdown summary.
